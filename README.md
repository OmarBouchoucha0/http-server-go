# Introduction
This is a personal learning project aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of web servers, HTTP protocols, and network programming concepts. It is designed for educational purposes and personal exploration, providing hands-on experience with building and running an HTTP server from scratch.

## Technologies Used

* Language: Go to gain proficiency in language-specific features and idioms.
* Networking: Utilizes socket programming and network libraries to handle TCP connections, listen for incoming requests, and manage client-server communication.
* HTTP Protocol: Implements HTTP protocol parsing, request handling, and response generation according to the HTTP specifications.
* Concurrency and Asynchronicity: Explores concurrency models and asynchronous programming(goroutines, channels, workgroupes ...) techniques to handle multiple client connections and requests efficiently.
